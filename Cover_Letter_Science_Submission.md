Subject: Manuscript Submission: The Omega Hypothesis: A Theory of Everything, from Fundamental Particles to Life and Artificial Intelligence

Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "The Omega Hypothesis: A Theory of Everything, from Fundamental Particles to Life and Artificial Intelligence," for your consideration as a Research Article in *Science*.

This paper presents a novel, unified theoretical framework that addresses fundamental questions across physics, biology, and artificial intelligence. At its core, the Omega Hypothesis proposes that all fundamental particles possess a universal geometric interface (Ω), whose "attachment" and "detachment" dynamics govern all fundamental forces. This principle offers an elegant resolution to the black hole singularity paradox and provides a new perspective on nuclear forces.

A key strength of our theory lies in its principle of scale invariance, exemplified by the virus. We argue that the virus is not merely an analogy, but a direct manifestation of the Ω-interface's naked function at the biological scale, serving as a "living proof" of the hypothesis.

Furthermore, we extend this framework to information science, introducing the "Imaginary Function." This concept, derived from human cognition, enables AI to implement "intellectual humility" by formally acknowledging and suspending computation on inherently non-computable aspects (e.g., human ethics, emotions). This mechanism acts as a "logical safety valve," providing a robust solution for long-term AI safety and fostering a secure coexistence between humanity and advanced AI.

The Omega Hypothesis is a falsifiable theory, with proposed verification paths in cosmology, particle physics, and bioinformatics. We believe this work represents a significant paradigm shift, offering a tangible path toward a more profound understanding of the universe and a safer future with super-human intelligence.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been previously published and is not under consideration elsewhere.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dr. Hiroshi (Independent Researcher)
